Algebraic effects &amp; handlers have become a standard approach for working with side-effects in functional programming languages. Their modular composition with other effects and clean separation of syntax and semantics make them attractive to a wide audience of programmers. However, not all effects can be classified as algebraic; some need a more sophisticated handling. In particular, effects that have or create a delimited scope need special care, as their continuation consists of two parts—in and out of the scope—and their modular composition with other effects brings in additional complexity. This class of effects is called scoped effects and has gained attention by their growing applicability and adoption in popular libraries. Although calculi have been designed with algebraic effects &amp; handlers as first-class operations, effectively easing programming with those features, a calculus to support scoped effects &amp; handlers in a similar matter is missing from the literature. In this work we fill this gap: we present a novel calculus, in which both algebraic and scoped effects &amp; handlers are first-class. This involves the need for polymorphic handlers and explicit forwarding clauses to forward unknown scoped operations to other handlers. Our calculus is based on Eff, an existing calculus for algebraic effects, extended with Koka-style row polymorphism, and consists of a formal grammar, operational semantics and (type-safe) type-and-effect system. We demonstrate the usability of our work by discussing a range of scoped effect examples. In summary, our novel calculus allows modular composition of different algebraic and scoped effects &amp; handlers and eases programming with these features.

<p>
In Haskell, both thunks and values are generally represented as a heap-allocated closure [18]. This introduces overhead, as the heap generally is much slower than the stack. To combat this inefficiency, programmers can use unboxed types [19]. These types are represented directly on the stack, and therefore do not carry such overhead. So far, only data values such as Int and Char can be unboxed. In this thesis we explore the possibility of extending this notion, allowing for function values to be unboxed as well. As functions can close over variables, they must be represented as a closure. Therefore, unboxing function values requires representing closures on the stack. This introduces a significant challenge, as variations in the set of closed over variables now affect the stack representation. We propose an extension to function types, where the types of the closed over variables are annotated on the function arrow. These annotations make it possible to reason about the exact runtime representation of a closure at compile time. We do so by presenting two languages, L and M, and a compilation function L → M. Furthermore, we identify the key correctness criteria of L → M, and proof that they hold.
